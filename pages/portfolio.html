                  <p class="portfolio-p-in-modal">I was recently asked, "What is your proudest accomplishment while at General Assembly?"
                    While I can point to individual projects, gaining specific pieces of knowledge, or simply making it through the program,
                    my proudest accomplishment is the confidence that I have gained, not in my abilities, but rather in my capacity to tackle
                    an assignment. With each project that we were given, the complexity and demands increased and yet my confidence in
                    completing the project also increased.</p>
                  <p class="portfolio-p-in-modal">Upon receiving the requirements for project one, I found myself thinking that I had no
                    idea where to start. My skillset was extremely limited. My knowledge of which resources to turn to was almost nonexistent.
                    My confidence was not high.</p>
                  <p class="portfolio-p-in-modal">Upon receiving the requirements for project four, my confidence in being able to overcome
                    the challenge, to strategically think through how to deliver an MVP, and to know which resources to seek out was high.
                    I didn't know everything going into project four. We spent about a week discussing ruby and less than two days discussing
                    rails and yet I knew that I could deliver.</p>
                  <p class="portfolio-p-in-modal">I have a lot left to learn. But right now, after 12 weeks of learning, coming into this
                    program with zero knowledge about web development, I'm most proud of the confidence that I have gained in tackling the
                    learning that I still have left to do and the confidence that I now have in completing projects and assignments that are
                    given to me.

                  <p class="portfolio-p-in-modal">I love basketball. I've been playing since I was old enough to hold a ball. That being said,
                    I'm not a natural athlete. I can't dunk. I'm not exceptionally fast. I've never even been able to palm a ball.
                    But I'm a workhorse. I have a clear idea of what good basketball looks like. I practiced and practiced my technical skills.
                    I loved the dirty work in a game; boxing out, banging for position in the post, making a clean outlet pass. I won't throw a
                    behind the back, no-look pass when there's a perfect, textbook bounce pass to be made for a fast break layup. I love setting up
                    my teammates, making them look better. And I'm never satisfied. I have always worked to get better. This is how I've always played
                    basketball. I work hard. It may not always be flashy, but I get the job done and I get the job done well.</p>
                  <p class="portfolio-p-in-modal">It's early in my web development experience, but I'm finding that these same traits from the
                    basketball court are finding their way into my web development strategies. For project 2, we were tasked with developing a
                    CRUD app using Express, NodeJS, and MongoDB. From the beginning, I had a clear vision of what I wanted, I put my head down, did
                    the technical work, and produced a final product that I'm proud of. I'm not a naturally gifted coder, I won't create the flashiest
                    product. But I'll put in the work. I'll constantly work on getting better. I'll create a product that is functional, designed to
                    make the client experience the best it can be. It's still early, but I'm starting to develop an idea of the type of coder I am and
                    can be.

                  gitFit is a MEAN stack application built collaboratively allowing users to track fitness goals. The application utilizes the Materialize
                  CSS framework for styling and Passport for user authentication and authorization.

                  create groups.

                  <p class="portfolio-p-in-modal">gitFit is the first application that I have worked on in a collaborative setting.
                    Entering into the project, I was worried about communication, how best to divide and delegate tasks, how to
                    effectively use git and GitHub as a team, and all of the typical fears that come from a history of poor group project
                    experiences in grade school. My worries and fears vanished upon our first meeting as a team. Even in the first meeting,
                    it was clear that we were going to communicate effectively. We made a clear and executable plan for managing our git
                    pushes, pulls, and feature branches. We thought through and defined our MVP so that we had a vision to guide us throughout
                    the process. As with any application, there are improvements and extra features that we would like to add to version 2.0,
                    but we met the expectations for the project in the time allotted, working together effectively and smoothly.</p>
                  <p class="portfolio-p-in-modal">Similar to Project 1, this project helped me see how my previous career and its
                    skills will aid me in this new career. On a daily basis as a school counselor, I needed to listen, ask follow-up questions
                    for further depth of understanding, summarize and articulate problems and solutions, and facilitate discussion and collaboration.
                    Throughout the process of creating gitFit, I relied on these skills to assist in keeping our team focused, pushing for further
                    understanding when team members weren't on the same page, and helping team members to find solutions and resources when they were
                    stuck on a coding problem. I'm excited to continue my development with the MEAN stack as I have a lot of growth still to make, but
                    I am excited to find a need and a use for the skills that I am bringing with me.

                  player will be prompted to start over. Unless the player chooses to reset the game by clicking on the
                  reset button, the high score will be maintained and displayed.

                  <p class="portfolio-p-in-modal">I'm an educator trying to become a web developer. A school counselor used to relying on
                    soft skills now utilizing newly learned hard skills. And yet, during the first project for our class, I found out just
                    how valuable those soft skills can be in this new endeavor. Relying on persistince, creativity, time management, goal-
                    setting, problem-solving, and communication skills ended up being just as necessary as the knowledge needed to code. In
                    the end, Project 1 left me feeling confident that I could create an MVP, confident that I have the soft skills needed to
                    persist and succeed in this field, and very much aware that I still have so much to learn.</p>

                      <li class="portfolio-li"> I understood when to ask for help and was able to form clear and direct questions when needed </li>

                    <ul>
                      <li class="portfolio-li"> I did not have a full grasp on array data structures and the limitations in comparing arrays
                        to arrays. Because I set the game up to compare a computer generated array versus a player generated array, the
                        game does not work exactly as a simon-style game should.</li>
                      <li class="portfolio-li"> I struggled with my game logic attempting to use an if/else statement. Dr. Mike though helped
                        me to see the benefits to using a switch statement instead. </li>
